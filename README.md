# pixi-plugin-example

Learn the ways of making renderer plugins for pixi.js of version 4.

Currently supports only ES5 + browserify, gonna add more dialects later. 

## getting started

Just copy these files to start your own pixi plugin.

Example plugin just renders single sprite

## Usage example

```
// create a sprite
var sprite = new PIXI.Sprite();
// set the renderer plugin
sprite.pluginName = 'picture';
```

## How to build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Files

1. package.json - please change author, version and npm name

2. bin/pixi-picture.js - generated by npm, include this file from html code to use the plugin

3. src/index.js - hook into pixi namespace
